In today's technological era, gesture recognition is a trending topic. The primary goal is to identify human gestures using machine learning and mathematical algorithms for human-computer interaction. There are just a few forms of Human-Computer Interaction, such as keyboard, mouse, and touch screens. When it comes to adapting more adaptable technology to computers, each of these gadgets has its own constraints.

## why guesture recognition ? 

Gesture recognition is one of the most important strategies for creating user-friendly interfaces. Gestures can arise from any physical move or condition, but most typically from the face or hand. Users may interact with gadgets via gesture recognition without physically touching them. The use of different technologies and machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize and comprehend distinct human gestures, making human-machine communication more successful. This might render conventional input devices like touchscreens, mouse pads, and keyboards obsolete.

There are several Machine Learning algorithms to recognize hand gestures, down below is the list of algorithms and the methodologies followed using these algorithms. 

 - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
 - K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
 - Decision Trees (DT)
 - Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

## Neural Networks

CNN's are a subset of deep learning neural networks that are employed in the analysis of pictures and video. It is made up of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Backpropagation is used for increased accuracy and productivity. It trains and verifies the computer's recognition of human gestures. Page turning, and zooming in and out are examples of interactions. 
For hand gesture recognition the number of fingers present in the hand gesture is calculated by CNN, using fault spots in the gesture. The acquired gesture is passed via a 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network. CNN is used in succession to recognize the current gesture. The identified gesture is utilized as input to accomplish the user's desired actions.
